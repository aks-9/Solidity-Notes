* aTokens
When we deposit our collarteral to AAVE, we actually get back an 'aToken', or an interest bearing token. These tokens keep track of how much collateral( WETH ) we've deposited in the AAVE protocol.

* To withdraw our WETH, we burn these 'aTokens' or 'aWETH' tokens.

* You can also import these tokens into your Metamask, and depending upon the interest, it will keep going up after some time, and it will be visible in your Metamask.
