          In 'performUpKeep' function we changed the state from 'open' to 'calculating'. But 'performUpKeep' function can only be called when 'checkUpKeep' function returns 'upKeepNeeded' as 'true'. 
          
          Otherwise it will revert with 'Raffle__upKeepNotNeeded'.
          
          So we need to make 'checkUpKeep' function return 'true', and once we get it 'true', then we'll call 'performUpKeep' function to put Raffle contract in the 'calculating' state.  

          For 'checkUpKeep' to be 'true', we need 'upkeepNeeded' to be 'true'.
          
          //* upkeepNeeded = (timePassed && isOpen && hasBalance && hasPlayers);

          ==> 'upkeepNeeded' will only be true, when raffle is in 'open' state, has at least one player, has some balance in the contract, and a predefined time interval has passed.

          Now we need to pass the time between two raffles. Only when the time passsed is greater than the 'interval' set by contract, can we proceed further.

          But if the interval is large, we can't wait for it to pass in our testing. So we use two special Hardhat methods to manipulate, and speed up the blockchain in terms of time. These methods are 'evm_increaseTime' and 'evm_mine'.

          'evm_increaseTime' increases the time of our blockchain, and 'evm_mine' mines new blocks.
